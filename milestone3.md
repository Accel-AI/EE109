# Milestone 3: Deploying Apps
In milestone 2, you have already developed your application in Spatial and verified that it was functionally correct. However, system architecture design is all about getting the correct results with the lowest latency and resource utilization. In this milestone, your task will be to tune your implementation such that the hardware resource uitilization is reasonable while keeping the same result as in the simulation. Please state the optimization you have done to maintain or improve the performance while keeping the resource utilization reasonable. You can follow the instructions in the submission file.
