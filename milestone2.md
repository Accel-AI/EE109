# Milestone 2: Spatial Simulation
In the first milestone, you have already described your application in software. The process should also give you some insight on what needs to be accelerated on the hardware side. 

In this milestone, your task is to implement the acceleratable components in Spatial, and complete the functional and VCS simulation to verify the correctness. Please submit your Spatial implementation, with log files of Scala and VCS simulation results.
