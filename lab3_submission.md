## Part 1
Given the two kernels and the input data, perform 2 2-D convolution on the image. You can add your implementation to Lab3Part1Convolution. Report the resource utilization and cycle counts of your design. 
```scala
// Copy-paste your implementation here
```

## Part 2
Write the code that will traverse the matrix from top-left to bottom-right and update each entry of the score matrix.
```scala
// Copy-paste your implementation here
```

## Part 3
Write the code that can traceback from the bottom-right to the top-left of the score matrix. You can add your implementation in Lab3Part2OptimizeHomework. Report the resource utilization and cycle counts of your implementation.
```scala
// Copy-paste your implementation here
```
